,,,The current policy of NAI will continue through all timeframes. Works may be necessary to maintain the viability of the RNLI Station at South Landing; these will be permitted subject to necessary approvals.,,
,,,"The current defence line will be held throughout all timeframes, however if the marina development goes ahead, the defence line may be locally realigned seawards of its current position. If monitoring supports it, defence works may need to be considered to manage outflanking and protect the town of Bridlington. Further action will be taken to sustain the current level of flood risk into the future (responding to the potential increase in risk from climate change). ",,
,,,"No Active Intervention will occur through all timeframes. However, works may be necessary to maintain the functionality of Barmston Drain.",,
,,,"The current defence line will be held throughout all timeframes.  If monitoring supports it, defence works may need to be considered to manage outflanking to protect the town of Hornsea. Monitoring will be undertaken to assess when this may be required.

,,,"The policy of No Active Intervention would continue for the currently undefended sections through all timeframes. However, works may be necessary to maintain a sustainable flood defence in the vicinity of Tunstall Drain. At Mappleton, the current defence line will be held with monitoring of coastal processes undertaken. In the medium-term, an assessment of options for maintaining a strategic north-south transport link is likely to be necessary. Monitoring will be undertaken to determine whether continuing to hold the line at Mappleton is still sustainable in the long-term and options may be considered.",,

,,,"Management policy will be to continue to protect the Gas Terminals in line with the exisiting planning permission for the Gas Terminal site and as long as the planning status allows defences. No Active Intervention for will continue for currently undefended areas, however management of outflanking may be permitted, subject to necessary approvals to protect the nationally important gas supplies and while there is a strategic need for the site.
