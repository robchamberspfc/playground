let content = "Here is a markdown description with some special characters such as ampersand & percent % and dollar $. Here is an unordered list using asterisks: * outward: the direct investments of UK-resident companies in other countries * inward: the direct investments in the UK from non-resident companies Here is an unordered list using hyphens: - outward: the direct investments of UK-resident companies in other countries - inward: the direct investments in the UK from non-resident companies Here is an ordered list using numbers: 1. Investment of UK companies abroad (outward) and foreign companies into the UK (inward), including investment flows, positions and earnings, by country, component and industry. 2. Detailed inward and outward statistical tables are published with this bulletin. 3. These statistics are presented using the directional principle, as opposed to the asset and liability principle. Further information on the differences between these principles can be found here. 4. Estimates are net values from the perspective of the parent company (ie. the value of loans provided to the subsidiary by the parent, minus the value of loans provided to the parent by the subsidiary). 5. Statistics also report on the immediate investment rather than the ultimate controlling parent company or ultimate host country. Here are various headings: # H1 ## H2 ### H3 #### H4 ##### H5 ###### H6 Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style: Alt-H1 ====== Alt-H2 ------ Emphasis and strikethroughs: Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_. Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__. Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**. Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~ [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com) [I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com 'Google's Homepage') [I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text] [I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE) [You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1] Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote."
